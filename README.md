# MilimoChat

MilimoChat is a sophisticated, locally-run chat application engineered for users who prioritize privacy, customization, and a deep understanding of their AI interactions. Built using Python and Streamlit, MilimoChat offers an intuitive interface to engage with powerful language models, manage extensive chat histories, and fine-tune every aspect of the chatbot experience. What sets MilimoChat apart is its unique memory capabilities, including both short-term and long-term memory, allowing it to provide context-aware responses and learn from interactions over time. Unlike cloud-based solutions, MilimoChat ensures your conversations and data, including its memory, remain entirely on your local machine, giving you complete control over your information. It's designed for users who want more than just a chatbot â€“ they want a personal AI concierge that learns from their interactions, adapts to their preferences, and provides insightful analytics on their communication patterns, all within a secure, customizable environment.

The settings section (`main.py`) in the sidebar allows users to personalize their chat experience:
- **Model Selection**: Users can choose from a list of available language models (e.g., llama2, llama3) to power the chatbot.
  To change the default `VISION_MODEL` and `EMBED_MODEL`, modify the `config.py` file.
- **Personality Presets**: Offers a selection of personality presets (e.g., Professional, Creative, Informative) that define the chatbot's behavior and tone.
- **Tone and Creativity Control**: Sliders to adjust the tone (e.g., Formal, Balanced, Casual) and creativity level (e.g., Conservative, Balanced, Creative) of the chatbot's responses.
- **Memory Controls**: Toggles to enable or disable chat memory, allowing users to control context retention.
- **Clear Chat Button**: A button to clear the current chat history and start a new conversation.

### History Analytics (components/history_analytics.py)

![History Analytics](assets/screenshots/milimochat-3.png)

The history analytics view (`HistoryAnalytics`) provides insights into past conversations:
- **Chat History Display**: Shows a searchable and filterable history of all conversations.
- **Message Search**: Allows users to search for specific keywords or phrases within the chat history.
- **Date Filtering**: Enables users to filter messages by date range.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Presents key metrics and visualizations, including:
    - **Total Messages**: The total number of messages exchanged.

### Memory Dashboard (components/memory_dashboard.py)

**Session Persistence**: MilimoChat uses session IDs to store chat memories in a local database. To ensure persistent memory across application shutdowns and restarts, it's essential to bookmark the application URL or save the session ID from the URL. This allows you to return to the same session and access your past chat history and long-term memories.
